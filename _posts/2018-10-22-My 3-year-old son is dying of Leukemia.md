I recently created a petition to paradigmly shift the emoji industry. The following is a comment left on the petition, possibly by someone other than myself.

My 3-year-old son is dying of Leukemia. I'm still coming to terms with the incredibly low estimate of his life. It's frustrating, as a parent; we try everything to keep our kids healthy and happy, but with his disease, nothing works. I read to him (in vain), trying to calm him, but nothing seems to register. 

His development is slowed. While other children his age are already walking and talking, he can only lie in bed, waiting to be taken by his cancer. I've missed so many milestones: first steps, first words, 4th birthday.

But today, in a moment of pure clarity, his crying was alleviated; it seemed the entire sickness that plagued his fragile body for so long had disappeared. The usual dullness that lived deep within his eyes vanished. In place, an uncannily sharp spark of intelligence replaced it. Suddenly, in perfect clarity, I could *see* what he would look like as an adult, free from all the pain he currently feels. 

He turned to me with perfect grace and said with perfect, unbroken English befitting only the greatest poets, "Father. You must do everything in your power to get the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji approved by Unicode.

Rightfully, I was shocked. I had no idea who Unicode was, or what this Emoji was. As soon as a question registered with me, I turned to my son... and as quickly as his transformation had arrived, he was back to his usual self. Could it be a dream? But no, my new knowledge proved otherwise.

Two weeks later he passes away. My wife and I are heartbroken. Neither of us can come to terms with the pain of losing a child. I turn to meditation to cope.

Sitting by the quiet creek behind my house, I remember my son's dying wish and the peculiarity surrounding it. With the robot-like motions of just going through life after tragedy, I walk back into my house, sit on my computer, and look up the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji. This is the only result. I will sign.

For whatever reason, my dead son has led me here. I do not know if it was him, or some greater being speaking through him, but I have signed the petition. Thank you.
