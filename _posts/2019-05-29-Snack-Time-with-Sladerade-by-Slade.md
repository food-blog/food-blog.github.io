 [Snack Time with Sladerade](https://snacktimewithsladerade.blogspot.com/)
## Audience
The blog targets English teachers and those who seek nostalgia brought by reading about "quality childhood foods".
## Purpose
The author writes primarily about popular childhood foods, but this is really an all-purpose blog. It shows how food impacts our life and the parallels that can be made to other, seemingly impossible to connect, areas of our lives. Schemmer uses cake to bridge an outdated us and them mentality, speaks about his personal life, and most commonly, seeks to invoke nostalgia about food.
## Appeals
### Ethos
As someone who has had a childhood before, Schemmer is a perfect candidate to write a blog about childhood food.
### Logos
The author reflects on his inner thoughts and memories and logically connects them to a broader scope. This scope could be something shared by many, a connection to philosophy, or a connection to other, different inner thoughts.
### Pathos
> Envision this, a steaming pot of ooey gooey golden goodness. As you use one of those oversized serving spoons, the cheese of every individual piece of pasta starts to string. Mmmmm, even just thinking about this makes my mouth water.

I honestly feel like I'm cheating, writing about the pathos in this blog. Schemmer just makes it too easy! Almost anyone who grew up under American food traditions (which really didn't change that much over the years) can relate to what he writes, or at least find some nostalgia.
## Organization
### Diction
The author speaks casually in a unique voice that he can easily be attributed to. His use of language helps his pathos, and his distinct style and fluency in storytelling help his ethos.
### Syntax
The author writes around the most important part of the sentence. The emphasis of the sentence is always around what is important to the reader.
### Imagery and Allusion
Actual images aren't as common here as in other blogs, but imagery in writing is everywhere. The author doesn't just *tell* a story, he *relives* a story and allows the reader to accompany him.
### Figurative Language
> On it, there was this ginormous mountain of  
spinach so tall that even Mount Everest would cower in fear.

There is a *lot* of figurative language here, mostly in the form of hyperbole or situational irony. This aids Schemmer's purpose as it develops his voice and keeps the readers attentive.
