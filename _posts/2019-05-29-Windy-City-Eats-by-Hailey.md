## Audience
Tourists going to Chicago would want to read this blog so that they can make a good choice on where to eat. Specificially, this targets tourists who "do not want to lose weight" as the Chicago food is "gargantuan".
## Purpose
The author seeks to impart her first-hand knowledge to potential visitors of Chicago.
## Appeals
### Ethos
> I lived in Chicago for 11 years and experienced much of the best food that Chicago has to offer... In fact, after 11 years as a Chicagoan, I think that you can call me a “Chicago Foodie” professional.

The author is a veteran Chicagoan whose personal experience allows her to speak with authority on the subject of Chicago food.
### Logos
One of the big logos parts of these blog posts is the logical claim that *if you eat the food, you'll get fat quickly, which means that the food is really good because otherwise you would not become fat*. Maybe there's a fallacy in there somewhere, but I dunno, I'm not a docotor.
### Pathos
> Eating a piece of deep dish pizza is a cheesy, gooey experience.

The author uses selective word choice to affect emotionally appeal to the audience.
## Organization
### Diction
The wordchoice used is very distinct; reading this is almost like some kind of survival guide on how to avoid obesity in Chicago. The way she writes about it makes me very grateful that my plane back from Chicago was able to achieve lift.
### Syntax
The audience is directly addressed by the author in all of her posts. As a result, reading this blog is a personal experience and a direct delegation of knowledge. This helps make a connection between the author and the reader, which develops the author's ethos and supports that she is a credible figure.
### Imagery and Allusion
Imagery really supports the author's ethos; the food is vividly pictured, as is the imagery of readers getting fat from their eats. This definitely invokes positive emotion about the food.
### Figurative Language
> A single piece weighs about as much as a small child.

This blog feels like its all figurative language. It's a weird (and awesome) mix of hyberole and irony, which is great because reading it is really interesting. If you haven't already read this blog, it's a hybrid of a food guide and a purging guide, which of course, isn't what the food experience is actually like in Chicago. <sup>At least I hope it isn't. I dunno though, the author is an expert on this stuff.</sup>
