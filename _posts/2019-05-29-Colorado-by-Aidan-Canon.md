## Audience
Cannon's blog's title, *Colorado*, is a pretty good name for a blog about food in Colorado. He specifically focuses on Littleton, where I'm guessing he lived before. His audience is people interested in Colorado food (likely tourists or residents), or people interested in reading food blogs written by tenth graderes (likely Ms. Hooker).
## Purpose
The purpose of the blog is to illustrate restaurants in Littleton, Colorado. Although the message does not specifically target towards tourists, it can be used as a restaurant guide for visitors.
## Appeals
### Ethos
I'm ~~guessing~~ *very sure* that the author is from Colorado. This is never explicitely mentioned (at least when I checked the blog), but is heavily implied due to his wealth of knowledge about the place, and by how he recounts *first hand experiences* about restaurants. Cannon's "in the field" work gives him more ethos than someone who only knew about these places from external research.
### Logos
Cannon's logos comes in the form of his first hand experience, and how he elaborates on his thoughts to persuade or dispersuade the reader to go to a restaurant.
### Pathos
The author uses a lot of pathos, as is a common trend in food blogs. He recounts experiences that you can laugh at, empathize with, or become interested from.
## Organization
### Diction
The writing style is very causual and natural. It feels like the author is directly speaking to the readers here. This tone aids his purpose of informing the reader about Littleton restaurants with personal anecdotes. Cannon here takes on the role of an experienced guide and enforces his ethos by speaking assuradely. Some of the stories here feel like traditional Tall Tales in terms of writing style, though without as much hyperbole.
### Imagery and Allusion
The author well describes each restaurant, and his own personality through his writing. Restaurants feel like a second home to the reader, after they're made aware of the lighting, atmosphere, architechural design, surroundings, and even the number of TV's on the wall. The food itself is also discussed in great detail, including Cannon's reactions to various dishes.
### Figurative Language
> I tried to stay a glass half full, but I’m fairly certain I acted like a glass that was just completely empty.

Cannon uses a multitude of similies, metaphors, and a billion hyperboles to describe his experiences. They are well placed and add personality to each story, as well as valuable — and exaggerated — information.
