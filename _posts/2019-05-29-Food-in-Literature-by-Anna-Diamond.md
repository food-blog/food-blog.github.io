## Audience
> "I'm combining my two favorite things: books and foods."

*Food in Literature* is aimed primarily at reading enthusiasts who also enjoy food. The group is clearly not mutually exclusive. The author also shows her cooking creations on her site, bringing in potential "foody" readers as well. 
## Purpose
I'm assuming that the author is doing this in part due to an English assignment. Ignoring that motivation however, the author sets out to draw parallels between books and food by cooking food in literature. The blog title explains the mission statement well. She also motivates the reader to read a variety of other works and to cook their respective foods.
## Appeals
### Ethos
The author draws on her knowledge as an avid reader and experienced cook to bring ethos to her work. Her blog's mission is to cook food from literature, so having these qualities makes her a highly proficient figure in this realm.
### Logos
The blog doesn't really have anything that needs a logical appeal to back up. There are no statistics for *why* someone should read a book like *The Great Gatsby*, and then bake macaroons in order to satisfy a love of cooking and reading. It's not necessary here, and isn't used.
### Pathos
The blog relies heavily on appeal to emotion to motivate readers.
> "So grab your favorite book, a comfy chair, and bring your appetite as we eat and drink our way through the worlds literature!"

I'll explain more examples of this later on, but in essence, the author knows that her audience enjoys food, so she portrays what she cooks with an emphasis on smell, flavor, and taste. She knows that these descriptions will likely evoke strong emotions (likely desire, hunger, or comfort) within the reader.
## Organization
### Diction
As mentioned above with the pathos appeal, the author uses words that evoke emotion surrounding food. Words like "homely", "comfy", "tasty", "sweet", and "warm" motivate the audience to continue to read, and perhaps to later cook these meals for themselves.

The author also speaks in a clear and friendly tone. This isn't something distant and cold like a tutorial on how to file taxes, but something inviting and warm that encourages the reader to follow along with their own meal.
### Syntax
Each blog post is outlined with step by step cooking instructions prefaced by a brief overview of the food origin (the book) and a description of the food itself. The author formats her recipe section like any other cook book would, showing that the blog isn't about just conceptualizing food in literature, but about actually making it.
### Imagery and Allusion
Allusion doesn't really have a place in this blog, as each writing piece the author draws from has to be explicitly mentioned to fulfill her purpose.

Imagery, however, does play a large role here. Diamond uses actual images supported by descriptions to appeal to the reader's emotion (pathos). These images and imageric words help the reader better understand what they will be making, and motivate them to cook the food in the first place.
### Figurative Language
The author does not use figurative language, at least in the posts I sampled from.
