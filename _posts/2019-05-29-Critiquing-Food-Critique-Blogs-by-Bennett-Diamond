For my chronologically last post (you should be reading this last), I'm Critiquing my Own Blog that Critiques Other Food Critique Blogs (COBCOFC). The acronym is still a work in progress.

## Audience
This blog is for ~~cool kids only~~ English teachers, fellow students, or anyone else who wants to read about the very exciting topic of food rhetoric in sophomore food blogs.
## Purpose
The purpose of this blog is
* to serve as an excercise to help me understand rhetoric
* to pass Honors English 10
* and to read other food blogs written by my fellow students
## Appeals
### Ethos
The author's ethos is backed by the full strength of not having watched one, but *two* slideshow presentations about rhetoric.
### Logos
I'm to be honest here, I never really understood logos in the first place. On at least one post, I just left it out and hoped that nobody noticed that it was gone.
### Pathos
Please. Please grade this assignment well. *Please*, I'm begging. I'll *cry* if this isn't good.

That's an emotional appeal, right?
## Organization
### Diction
The author's word choice strengthens his ethos as it shows that he is able to use words, and being able to use words is very important in establishing one's credibility.
### Syntax
I'm going to be honest here, as well. On half of what I wrote, I left out syntax because I didn't understand it, or said something vauge after looking up what syntax was but not being able to find specific examples.
### Imagery and Allusion
> Restaurants feel like a second home to the reader, after they're made aware of the lighting, atmosphere, architechural design, surroundings, and even the number of TV's on the wall.

TOOT TOOT! That's the sound of ~~my~~ the *author's* own horn.
### Figurative Language
It's really subtle, but all of these posts are actually an analogy for death. Or a biblical allusion, whatever floats your English boat. I'm not going to explain it, because if you can't see the connection, then you should just stop reading now. I don't care if this is the first or last (or likely, only) post that you've read, just stop. You obviously don't deserve to read *ever* again if you can't figure it out.

And yes, I am wearing clothes, but they're just invisible if you can't understand this stuff.
