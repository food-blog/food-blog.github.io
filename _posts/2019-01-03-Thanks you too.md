"Have a nice meal," the waitress said with a pleasant voice. I eyed my meal hungrily. A grand turkey avocado sandwich awaited me.

"Thanks, you too-" I muttered, then grabbed my mouth. The restaurant immediately quieted as I realized my mistake. But it was too late. The words that would prove my social undoing were already uttered. I grasped for air desperately, trying to recover from my disastrous failure. To all the restaurant’s inhabitants — made by fate spectators to my misfortune — it might've looked like I was trying to inhale my sent out words, to take them back somehow. Oh, how I wish I could!

The waitress to whom I directed my mispeech towards immediately turned to vomit. Her disgust was made palpable in the hurled up spaghetti on floor; at least, what once was spaghetti. Other patrons had similar reactions. I knew that I had sacrificed my right to blame them when I had made my error.

Eternally, I will remember the moment, the source of my terrible insomnia today. It took twelve psychologists, two firemen, and the Air-Force's best men to undo the actions of that night. Everything except for the terrible emotional scars disappeared under government classified file 1876-B.
