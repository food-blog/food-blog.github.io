## What is CFCB?
*CFCB*, the name of this blog, stands for "Critiquing Food Critique Blogs". In this blog, I will halfheartedly critique my peers' food blogs. Think of these as amateur, armchair reviews from someone who doesn't fully grasp the concepts that they're writing about.

I say "critique", but the word doesn't really cover what I'm doing. I'm identifying the rhetoric used in other blogs; I'll be looking at appeals, audience, and language used by the author to develop their message. However, "Identifying Rhetoric in Other Food Blogs by the use of Appeals, Audience, and Language' (*IROFBAAL*) doesn't have the same ring to it that *CFCB* does.

I'm hoping that this will be a good excercise in preparing me for my future AP Language class next year. Furthermore, I'll be able to look at other blogs from my classmates, which should be an interesting experience. I'm also writing this blog because it's a very big assignment for my English class, and I don't have the extra credit points to avoid doing this.
