[MALAYSIAN FOOD AS DESCRIBED BY SHANE](https://shaneshistoryoffood.blogspot.com/2019/05/the-history-of-food-introduction.html)
## Audience
The blog's audience is anyone who wants to learn more about the rich history of Malaysian food.
## Purpose
> "The idea of this blog is to try and learn about the wonderful and complex food that is Malaysian food. We will discover what makes Malaysian food Malaysian, the iconic dishes, ingredients, and history of the food."

The author clearly describes the blog's purpose in his first post: to learn about Malaysian food.
## Appeals
### Ethos
> I know very little about Malaysian food, and will learn about it with the reader.

The author does not possess ethos from first hand experience, but has large sums of research due to his knowledgebility on the subject. He speaks in a clear tone that suggests a substantial amount of research has gone into this project.
### Logos
Hilton uses logos in the form of factoids and elaborations on the subject of Malaysian food.
### Pathos
Words that evoke emotion like "crazy", "creative", or "colorful" appeal to the reader's emotions. Images certainly do support these ascertains, too.
## Organization
### Diction
The author writes informed, but also casually. These traits help the reader easily follow along with interest as the audience learns more about Malaysian food. Like I said in the pathos part, Hilton uses specific words that result in desired emotions of interest and hunger.
### Imagery and Allusion
Images of Malaysian food are common throughout the blog. This is beneficial, as I had no idea what Malaysian food looked like before, so these help me better picture the food. As always, images of food also appeal to the reader's pathos; carefully picked pictures portray palatable (I'll stop with the alliteration) meals that make the reader want to aquire first hand experience about Malaysian food.  
### Figurative Language
Each blog post is full of figurative language. Irony is common in Hilton's writing:
> Also, in true Malaysian fashion, the dish is eaten with only your hands, because everyone knows that sticky rice and rotten fish make for the perfect combo of clean, easy eating.

Also found is hyperbole, similies, metaphors, and personificiation that interest the reader and help to develop the author's voice.
